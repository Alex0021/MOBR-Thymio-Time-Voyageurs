Through it's sensors the thymio then perform a linear regression to each groups of points to better approximate it's environements. Points are detected as singular group, represented as a point. When groups of point are closer than the width of the thymio, it merges then as 1 group.\n",

    "Kalman filters can be used in linear systems but because our robot can move freely in 2 dimensions and can rotate as well, our system is therefore non-linear. We then have to use an Extended Kalman Filter where we first linearize our system. We can thus model our system with the following equations :\n",

    "The Kalman filter is composed of two steps : prediction and update. \n",
    "In the former, we use a state space model to predict the position of the robot at time t+1 (which is what we basically did in the images at the top). The second step can only be used when the camera is on as it is where the robot's path is corrected by combining the information of the camera and the prediction made by the filter. \n",
